# Circlo Android App
Circlo is an Android Native App using Kotlin as an open-source programming language maintained by Kotlin Foundations and is the official language supported by Google for Android development. This app uses architectural concepts with MVVM principles and also assisted by DaggerHilt to reduce the complexity of setting up and configuring dependency injection in Android projects and then we used Retrofit2 and Gson to communicate easily with the backend API.

## Main Features
